# EEE241-Assignment
This is a **BJT amplifier circuit simulation** designed using Proteus. The circuit features a **BC547C transistor** in a common-emitter configuration, amplifying the input signal (VG1) to produce a higher gain output. The simulation results show the input and output waveforms , demonstrating signal amplification.
